# Linked List and Data Structure Implementations in C

This repository provides comprehensive implementations of various data structures in C, including linked lists, stacks, and queues. It offers solutions for different types of linked lists, as well as stack and queue data structures using both arrays and linked lists.

## Overview

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The last node points to `NULL`, indicating the end of the list.

**Features:**
- Insertion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Deletion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Display
- Display Reverse
- Search
- Update
- Free List

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list includes an additional pointer to the previous node, allowing traversal in both forward and backward directions.

**Features:**
- Insertion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Deletion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Display
- Display Reverse
- Search
- Update
- Free List

### Circular Linked List

In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure that allows continuous traversal.

**Features:**
- Insertion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Deletion (Beginning, End, Specified Position)
- Display
- Display Reverse
- Search
- Update
- Free List

### Stack

Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structures. This project includes implementations using both arrays and linked lists.

**Array-Based Stack Features:**
- Push
- Pop
- Peek (Top Element)
- Display
- Check if Empty
- Check if Full

**Linked List-Based Stack Features:**
- Push
- Pop
- Peek (Top Element)
- Display
- Check if Empty

### Queue

Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures. Implementations are provided using both arrays and linked lists.

**Array-Based Queue Features:**
- Enqueue (Add Element)
- Dequeue (Remove Element)
- Peek (Front Element)
- Display
- Check if Empty
- Check if Full

**Linked List-Based Queue Features:**
- Enqueue (Add Element)
- Dequeue (Remove Element)
- Peek (Front Element)
- Display
- Check if Empty
